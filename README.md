# ALX System Engineering and DevOps

This repository contains programs created for the 'ALX Africa SE' system engineering and DevOps track. I worked with Bash on these projects and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I became acquainted with the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. The following is a specific list of projects:
